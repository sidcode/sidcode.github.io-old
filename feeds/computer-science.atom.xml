Information Processing and Storage at the same space and time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have your undivided attention, it would be worth the spacetime to take a look at the research being conducted on &lt;strong&gt;Memcomputing&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memcomputing is a theorized notion introduced in the 70's which is currently being realized by nanoparticles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It utilizes the features of special materials on the nanoscale - memcomputers, memresistors, memcapacitors, meminductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent arXiv paper on &lt;em&gt;Universal Memcomputing Machines&lt;/em&gt; convinces me that Moore's law is here to stay. It surpasses the von Neumann bottleneck that code and data have to be stored at different places but still depend on each other. Memory devices like those mentioned above maintain a history of the current, charge, and flux respectively. This enables them to act like normal electric components as well as instill them with the properties of a transistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Turing would be so proud!&lt;/p&gt;
