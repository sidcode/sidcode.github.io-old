A common section in all application forms is the Curriculum Vitae/Résumé. Having made 2 versions of my résumé in Microsoft Word, the FOSS enthusiast in me felt the pinch. I decided- my résumé should be in LaTeX - the typesetting framework based on Knuth's TeX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just a theoretical knowledge of how LaTeX worked, I probed into the open-source community. Forked Debarghya Das' résumé which I liked because of its brevity and summarization in just one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exercise taught me the importance of documentation, yet again. I was not merely modifying someone's LaTeX code. The documentation was edifying and I actually learnt a lot in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, enough said. I urge you to try out LaTeX if you haven't already. It has a steep learning curve for certain - but I am sure the hacker in you will be happy to help you climb the TeXy mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, back to completing my application forms :) &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="computers"></category><category term="foss"></category><category term="open source"></category><category term="typesetting"></category><category term="professional"></category></entry></feed>
